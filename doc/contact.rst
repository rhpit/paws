Currently #paws irc channel is not opened world-wide, it is hosted at
irc.devel.redhat.com and we are working figuring out a new home.

Same as above we are working moving to a world-wide mailing list soon.

Feel free to reach out/sign up to our mailing list <paws@redhat.com>. This

have. This list also will provide updates about upcoming releases.
